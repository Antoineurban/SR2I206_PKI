# PKI implementation on a blockchain

This project aims to implement the tools of a PKI on a blockchain like [Ethereum](https://www.ethereum.org).

## Readings

Here are two articles that helped us building our contract:

 - [PKI Tools in EVM-based Blockchains](https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rebooting-the-web-of-trust/blob/master/topics-and-advance-readings/pki_tools_in_evm_blockchains.md) by [@christianlundkvist](https://github.com/christianlundkvist)
 - [Privacy based decntralized Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) implementation using Smart contract in Blockchain](https://isrdc.iitb.ac.in/blockchain/workshops/2017-iitb/papers/paper-11%20-%20Decentralized%20PKI%20in%20blockchain%20and%20Smart%20contract.pdf) by Sivakumar P. and Dr. Kunwar Singh

## Tools

 - [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/), a Solidity IDE
 - [Solidity documentation](http://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/develop/index.html)

## Todo-list

 - [ ] Proceed advanced testing
 - [ ] Ensure security and privacy
 - [ ] JavaScript API?
